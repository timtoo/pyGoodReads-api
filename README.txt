GoodReads API
-------------

Most of the functional docs are currently docstrings in the code.

Primarily intended as a programming library, this seems reasonable for
now.


Tools
-----

pygrapi-tool - intended to be a general purpose command line interface
               to good reads functions

pygrapi-oauth - command line tool for setting up oauth authentication



Status
------

I haven't worked on this for a long time, and it seems unlikely I'll get
back to it any time soon.


Requirements
------------

- httplib2
- python-oauth2
